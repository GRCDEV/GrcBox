Woodstox - Stax2 implementation
-----------------------------------------------------------

"StAX2 is an experimental API that is intended to extend 
basic StAX specifications in a way that allows implementations 
to experiment with features before they end up in the actual 
StAX specification (if they do). As such, it is intended to 
be freely implementable by all StAX implementations same way 
as StAX, but without going through a formal JCP process."
