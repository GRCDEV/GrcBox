Apache Commons Logging
----------------------

"The Logging package is an ultra-thin bridge between different logging 
implementations. A library that uses the commons-logging API can be used with 
any logging implementation at runtime. Commons-logging comes with support for 
a number of popular logging implementations, and writing adapters for others 
is a reasonably simple task."
