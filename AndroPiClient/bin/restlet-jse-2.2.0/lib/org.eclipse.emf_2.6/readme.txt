"The EMF project is a modeling framework and code generation facility for 
building tools and other applications based on a structured data model. 
From a model specification described in XMI, EMF provides tools and runtime 
support to produce a set of Java classes for the model, along with a set 
of adapter classes that enable viewing and command-based editing of the 
model, and a basic editor."
