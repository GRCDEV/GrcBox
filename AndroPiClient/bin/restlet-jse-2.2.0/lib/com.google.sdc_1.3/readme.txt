SDC - Connect data from behind your firewall to Google Apps
-----------------------------------------------------------

"The Secure Data Connector (SDC) helps you build custom applications 
so that your Google Apps users can request access to this data. SDC 
lets you access your data from within Google Gadgets, Google App Engine, 
and Google Spreadsheets. SDC provides an agent to connect your 
Google Apps domain to your behind-the-firewall data sources. SDC lets you 
restrict which users and applications can make requests to your internal 
services. You can use our partners or your own internal authentication 
systems to validate and authorize those requests. SDC lets you extend your 
enterprise systems into Google Apps. You can easily build gadgets or
Google App Engine applications that make use of both private and public 
data."
