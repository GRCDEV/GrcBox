The "InterfaceManager" class has the functions that you need.


It has three public and static functions:

1. networkRestart() to restart NetworkManager.

2. updateNetworkInterfaceInformation() the update function, it must always be called before you can access the information.

3. getNetworkInterfaceInformation() to get the required infos.



Refer to the "NetworkTester" class which I had used to test the working of the library.
