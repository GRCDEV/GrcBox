GRCBox: Extending Smartphone Connectivity in Vehicular Networks

The GRCBox offers an architecture that extends the in-vehicle connectivity by providing both inter- and intra-vehicular communication support.

Using GRCBox each application can choose the interface for its data flows, which increases flexibility and will allow developers to easily implement applications based on ad-hoc connectivity, such as VDTN applications.

More documentation is available in the project [wiki](https://github.com/GRCDEV/GrcBox/wiki)
