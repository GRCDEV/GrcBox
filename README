GRCBox: Extending Smartphone Connectivity in Vehicular Networks

The low penetration of connectivity-enabled OBUs is delaying the
 deployment of Vehicular Networks (VNs), and therefore the 
development of Vehicular Delay Tolerant Network (VDTN) applications, 
among others. We propose GRCBox, an architecture based on RaspberryPi 
devices that allows integrating smartphones in VNs. GRCBox combines 
several SW modules to provide ad-hoc and multi-interface connectivity 
to smartphones. Using GRCBox each application can choose the interface 
for its data flows, which increases flexibility and will allow developers 
to easily implement applications based on ad-hoc connectivity, such as 
VDTN applications.
